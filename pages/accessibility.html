                    When we set out to evaluate our website's performance and accessibility, we decided to use two distinct tools: the Lighthouse Test and an evaluation through WebAIM.org. Our goal was to gain a comprehensive understanding of where our website stood in terms of user accessibility and overall performance.

                <h3>Lighthouse Test</h3>
                <p>
                    We started with the Lighthouse Test, a tool I had heard was incredibly effective for analyzing various aspects of a website. We accessed Lighthouse through Chrome DevTools, which was quite straightforward. After navigating to our website, I right-clicked on the page and selected "Inspect" to open the DevTools. There, we found the Lighthouse tab, which was our gateway to initiating the test.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Lighthouse interface, we were presented with several options for the audit. We chose to focus on performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO, as these were the areas we were most keen on improving. After selecting these categories, we clicked "Generate report." This action kicked off the automated process where Lighthouse ran its audits against our page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the report was generated, we dove into the results. The report was comprehensive, providing scores in each category. Our primary focus was on the accessibility score, which revealed some insightful details about how our website performed.

                <h3>Evaluation Test</h3>
                <p>
                    After Lighthouse, we turned our attention to the WebAIM evaluation. WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind) offers a tool called WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool), renowned for its effectiveness in identifying accessibility issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using WAVE was simple. We visited the WebAIM website and entered our site’s URL into the tool. The analysis began immediately, and soon we were presented with a report. Unlike the Lighthouse report, WAVE’s findings were visually oriented, making it easy to identify issues at a glance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The color-coded system in the WAVE report was particularly user-friendly. Errors were marked in red, alerts in yellow, and successful accessibility features in green. This visual representation helped us quickly understand the severity and nature of each issue. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each issue was accompanied by an explanation and a suggestion for improvement. This aspect of WAVE was educational, helping us understand not just what the issues were, but why they were issues and how we could fix them.
